# Painting Resources

## References

Painting birds requires very good source material, and birds are difficult to photograph well, even with good equipment. While I use my own photos occasionally (or those of my friends and family, with permission!), on the whole I rely on photo references taken by others.

Many of the references I use are in the public domain outright, but I’ve also frequently used Creative Commons licenses that allow derivative work and commercial distribution. These CC licenses usually require attribution, and whenever such paintings are displayed (in a gallery, on prints, etc.) I cite to the best of my ability the name of the original photographer and the type of license (usually CC BY).

Due to the difficulty of attributing a separate photographer as required by the CC BY license in places like a gallery setting, however, in some cases I’ve tried to reach out to the original photographer and come to an alternative arrangement, according to their preferences. [Nigel](https://www.flickr.com/photos/winnu/) of Flickr has granted me permission to paint from his photos entirely without attribution, and I am very grateful for that. (His work is all amazing! Go check it out!)

In all other cases, I acquire the rights for the images I use as reference, sufficient for me to display and make prints of paintings, etc.
