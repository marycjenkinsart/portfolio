# My Methods

## Paint

I started out with, and have since preferred, Winsor & Newton Artists’ Oil. I looked at the choices of dozens of artists, and felt that W&N was the best compromise between quality and price. I was also impressed by their range of single-pigment colors.

For water-soluable oils, I don’t have a clear favorite. Many brands offer a water-soluable oil line, but their ranges are greatly reduced in size and in quality, and the paints’ consistency is a concern. Royal Talens’ Cobra is close to how I like the paint to come out of the tube, but I’ve had to turn to other brands for specific pigments or to hit a desired pigment load, preferring Holbein Duo Aqua as my next favorite choice. I’m not satisfied with these paints yet, though, and in particular I’m unhappy with the bright yellows I’ve tried.

## Other Supplies

I use medium regularly to glaze and oil out, and my current preference is Gamblin Solvent-Free Gel, which comes in a metal tube; I might prefer Liquin better but it dries out *very* easily in its jar, and I thus waste most of what I buy.

For water-soluable oils, I use Royal Talens’ Painting Medium (091).

## Process

For the underpainting, I use paper towels and one dark, transparent pigment in solvent to put a medium tone on the board. Then, with brushes, paper towels, and Q-Tips, I add or remove paint to create the correct shapes and values. I try to really nail the shapes at this step, time permitting, because it makes the rest of the process a lot easier if I don’t have to correct anything.

Next I choose a section, generally the subject’s face, and try to fill in the large to medium shapes, starting with the darkest darks and the lightest lights. I move to the next section according to where I want the edges to “talk” in the time I am able to work. Further sessions might include additional sections, but I might also glaze to increase chroma or add additional layers to increase opacity as needed. Details are done last.

I like to have about a week in between sessions so the layers are properly dry. I especially like being able to wipe down something I didn’t like and “reset” to the previous session.
